             <h4> What lessons did I take from chapter 5? </h4>
             <p>I liked the stories about people who decided to change their lives and often they did an exercise like writing down what their
                life might be like in the future. It made me wonder if those exercises can be done by others or if it is the realisation of crisis in someones life which really motivates them. I feel like it would be a lot easier to motivate people if they could just
                do an exercise like that! 
             </p>
             <h4> How did I find two minutes of mindfullness? </h4>
             <p>Relaxing and energising. I nearly fell asleep. </p> 
             <h4> How did I find the pair programming? </h4>
             <p>I was not able to complete the pair programming exercise for this sprint but I am looking forward to it and hopefully I   
             can add my experiences in my next blog.
