<h4>What is grid based design? </h4>
<p> Grid based design is how many, if not all webpages, are layed out. From the design side a page is divided into a grid of rectangles of varying size in which is put content. Code-wise, this is acheviced by creating a row class which spans the width of the page, and 12 column classes, each spanning 1/12th of the width. 12 is chosen as these can be used to make a grid with divisons which can handle different sizes more easily.  </p>


 <h4>  Whats all the hype about responsive webpages? </h4>
<p> People view the internet on computers and devices of varying screen size or resolution, and responsive webpages are a way to ensure websites look good on all of them, by using code that changes how they look when necessary.   </p>

<h4>Semantic structure</h4>
<p> Semantic structure refers to how code is written, specifically its' clarity and readabilty. Code with good semantic structure should allow a developer to have a pretty good idea of how it will look as a webpage without opening it in a browser. This can be done by using indentation to make the structure clear, as well as tags that describe the meanging of an element, such as &ltimg&gt, &ltmain&gt, or &ltnav&gt, rather than just &ltdiv&gt or &ltspan&gt.  </p>
