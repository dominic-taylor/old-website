              <h4> Got blocked on a simple problem? </h4>
                <p>What was the problem?<br> Installing the JavaScript Functional Workshop. <br>   
                What problem solving techniques did you use?<br> Asked my accountabilty group and googled.  <br>
                How did you feel throughout the process? What did you learn?<br> Annoyed! It seemed like a lot of work to essentially set up some exercise questions. I learned about sudo and permisssions in the command line. <br>
                </p>
              <h4>Solved a problem in an elegant way?</h4>
                <p>What was the problem?<br>In my js racer game, I wanted to be able to allow the player to choose the length of the track  everytime they played, but couldn't figure out how to reset the table/racetrack length. <br>
                What problem solving techniques did you use?<br> I googled a lot, looked at other peoples code and tried to adapt it to my problem. I realised I could just call the page reload function after a winner was found, and in the end decided to use that. <br>
                How did you feel throughout the process? What did you learn?<br> I had the idea to reload the page early on but wanted to be able to code the solution manually. It was frustrating but the solution I did go with was adequate. By using reload(), it meant my other move counters, player postion etc, were reset as well so in the future I may use it if the information doesn't need to be remembered and I want to reset a program. <br>
             </p>
           
              <ul>
                  <li>Psuedocode</li>
                   <p>I use psuedocode as would be expected; at the start of a problem. It is good for breaking a problem down into parts which are easier to understand.</p>
                  <li>Trying something</li> 
                  <p>I do this all the time. I've noticed sometimes people are afraid to just try something because they're worried they will break the internet or something. I don't think I've ruined anything and I've tried many times. <p>
                  <li>Rubber ducky method</li>
                   <p>I am yet to try this with an inanimate object but often I will explain to someone why I am frustrated with a code and they will nod politely and softly murmur condolences.</p>
                  <li> Reading error messages</li> 
                  <p>Sometimes I know what an error message means. Other times I have no idea. It is especially annoying when you get an error message, change some code, and get exactly the same error message.</p>
                  <li>Console.logging</li>
                  <p>I found this useful to see if parts of code are connected up, like with event listeners, before they are attached to anything significant or with my user input track length in the js racer.  </p>
                  <li>Googling</li>
                   <p>I have googeld for help many times, although sometimes it feels a bit like cheating when the exact answer comes up. But if I've spent two hours or whatever going nowhere it might be ok. </p>
                  <li>Asking your peers for help</li> 
                  <p>I have a really good accountabilty group with on-to-it people and we ask each other for help often. </p>
                  <li>Asking coaches for help</li>
                  <p>I haven't done this as much, maybe because I don't see them on slack when I am but I would send them a message if I'm really stuck.</p>
                  <li>Improving your process with reflection </li>
                  <p>I not sure if I've done this either. Usually when I'm not doing dev academy I want to have a break and not think about it but I can see it could be useful to think about what and how I did so maybe I will try it.</p>
             </ul>
               
               
                 
            <h4>Explain to your non-tech friend</h4>
              <p>.map() <br> This allows you to copy the contents of an array, apply a function to them and put them into a new array. For instance if there is an array of numbers, numberArray, you could use .map() to add 5 to each of the elements and create an array with the new numbers. The original unchanged. </p>
              <p>.filter() <br> As the name suggests this allows you to test the elements of an array to met a condition, i.e >5 and copy them, or the elements that don't meet that condition to a new array.  </p>
              <p>.reduce() <br> From what I understand, reduce calls a function on an arrays elements and then puts all of those elements into one element in a new array. </p>
              </p>
            <h4>Recursion & Iteration</h4> 
              <p>Recursion and iteration are confusingly similar. They are both how a function may be repeated but do so differently. An iteration is the same block of code executed multiple times, while recursion is function code that calls itself. 
              <br>So iteration would look like; <br>    iteration()   iteration()   iteration()  <br> <br>
              And recursion looks like; <br>   <br>     recursion(recursion( recursion() ) )</p>
