          <h4>JavaScript Basics Reflection</h4>  

<h4>How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?
 </h4> <p>I would say JavaScript is a programming language that does things, like applications and programs a user can interact with, while HTML and CSS are code for the structure, design and look of webpages. I think this why I liked JS more, even though it is more complicated, because it feels logical to write instructions on how to actually do somthing, and I feel like I'm writing instructions on how to paint picture with HTML/CSS which is less of a direct connection between code and outcome.  </p>


 <h4>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life</h4>
<p>Control flow is code which asks if certain conditions are met, and if they are, then executes another piece of code. An example could be a smoke alarm, which will make a loud noise but only if it detects smoke, and is otherwise silent. A loop is code designed to repeatedly execute something until a condtion is met. An example of a loop would be filling a bucket with a shovel. The action of putting a spadeful of sand into the bucket is repeated until the condition, in this case the bucket being full, is met and the task is stopped. Loops and control flow statements can have simple or complex conditions, and can be combined for sophisticated functions.  </p>

<h4>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and object literals</h4>
<p>An array is a collection of data. In JS array data can be accessed by typing the name of the array, followed by brackets with the index of the specific data inside. The index numbers start from 0. For example, carArray[0] , is the string 'Truck', carArray[1], is 'Van'. Array data does not need to be the same type, so carArray[3] could be the number 19 etc. An object literal is a comma-separated list of name-value pairs wrapped in curly braces. Object literals can be of any type, like array data. To access object data you can use objectName.propertyName, or alternatively, objectName["propertyName"]. This will return the value associated wth the property name.

<h4>Explain what functions are and why they are useful</h4>
<p>Functions are code statements grouped together inside curly brackets which allow code to be executed together. They are useful because a function can be written once i.e <br> myCalcFunction(a, b, c) { <br> var answer = a * b + c; <br>
return answer; <br>  }  <br> and reused again, by just invoking the name i.e myCalcFunction(4, 5, 6) which saves time and space for a developer.   </p>
