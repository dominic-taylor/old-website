             <h4>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try? </h4>
<p> I read all the articles/watched the videos in the resources, and I have used the timeboxing technique. I'm also fond of going for a walk with no particular destination to chill out for a bit. </p>


 <h4> What did you find interesting? </h4>
<p> I liked the idea of forming a habit by taking an action and chunking it into a small achievable activity. I was interested in the idea of group flow where a team is "in the zone" because it seems like it would be a great way to get things done, and I've always thought of the flow concept as being a solitary experience.  </p>

<h4>What worked for you? </h4>
<p>I haven't had the opportunity to use much at this stage, but what didn't work for me was splitting my toggl timers into concepts or assignments, as I usually read a little of the resources, then do a little of the assignment and it didn't seem worth it to make seperate timers.              </p>

<h4>Which will you experiment further with? </h4>
<p>For the future I will remember the starting small and Minimal Viable Product concepts, as sometimes I have an idea I don't finish, (or even start) because it is quite big, and in my head I'm thinking of the time it will take to finish the whole thing, rather then an aspect I could complete and actually get some progress on.
