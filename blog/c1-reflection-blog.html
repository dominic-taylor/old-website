         <h4>  What's your take on the DBC / EDA experience? </h4>
          <p> I think it is very well put together. I like the focus on things other than coding and the staff I have met seem very genuine and committed. </p>

          <h4>What are your impressions? </h4>
            <p> The two thoughts that come to mind, is caring and intense.</p>

            <h4> How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture? </h4>
            <p>  I can seem myself really enjoying it but also at the same time I like my own time so being around a lot of outgoing people could be a challenge. </p>

            <h4>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how? </h4>
            <p>To be honest my expectations haven't changed that much. I am pretty cautious and really research a lot, before I have to commit to something requiring the investment of EDA. That being said it's the first week! I'm prepared to be surprised. </p>

            <h4>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous? </h4>
            <p> I'm very excited! I see it as a chance push myself and learn a whole new skill that will serve me well.
