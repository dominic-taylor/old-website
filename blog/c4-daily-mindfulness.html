             <h4> What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</h4>
             <p>I learned it took more effort than expected to not respond as I would in a normal conversation. It felt a bit strange to talk in a mindful way to someone but it was a positive experience after getting past that. I liked it in general because often people will not be honest or waffle on in conversation, for whatever reason, and getting to the nub of issues is the only way to solve them. The other peson in the conversation was shy at first but enjoyed it once they got into it.

             <h4> Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h4>
             <p>I like the simple practices like bringing attention to parts of the body, or focus on one breath. I also liked the image of being a grain of sand and a mountain at the same time. </p>
