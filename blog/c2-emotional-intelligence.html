             <h4>What lessons did you take from the first chapter of Search Inside Yourself? </h4>
             <p> I found it to be interesting and I am keen to learn more on the subect of Emotional Intelligence. I learned that mindfulness and awareness, of your  emotions and others, can be harnessed for performing work, leadership and creating the conditions for happiness. </p>


             <h4> How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness? </h4>
             <p>It was very relaxing. I found it best not to worry if I started to think about something, as worrying I was "doing it wrong" would only make it worse. When that happended I would try to let whatever thought it was drift off and focus on my breathing. </p>
