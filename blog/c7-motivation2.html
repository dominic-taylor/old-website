          <h4>Motivation </h4>  

<h4>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens? 
 </h4>
<p> 
I think this makes sense as a hierarchy of motivation. In my experience pleasure is pretty transitory, passion is more sustainable and purpose or meaningful  motivation is the best long term driver of action.  The difference between the first two is pretty clear, pleasure is what you feel you want to do and passion you feel you have to do. Purpose is more subjective and I think everyone has to decide what this is for themselves. Probably the closest I could explain it as, is the motivation you have to do things which achieve results for people other than yourself. I also had a thought that the three motivations are not necessarily exclusive within a person. For exmple a CEO of a company might get pleasure from coding, be passionate about the success of the business and feel it is their purpose to make it the best place for their employees. Or maybe they have a passion for scuba diving and their purpose is to go to church or all three are completely unrelated.   </p>
<h4>What are your core values?</h4>
  <p>
  Peace<br>
  Unity<br>
  Love<br>
  Having fun<br>
</p>  

 <h4>  What do you stand for?
 </h4>
<p> Broadly, I think I try to let myself and others do what they really think is right. If I have one magical dream it would be by the time of my death I would like every person alive to have the opportunities I have had in my life.

<h4>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?
</h4>
<p> I thought it was interesting and a good idea to allow your self to be used to failure by thinking about a time you experienced it. It takes a while for new skills to sink into the unconscious and become automatic and comfortable for the conscious mind, so sometimes if I'm trying to learn something I will do many many examples or exercises of it. This meditation exercise was sort of similar but was about getting used to the feeling of failure rather than getting used to failing a specific task, in order to feel more comfortable about failing in the future, AKA resilience!.   </p>

<h4>Any other musings</h4>
<p>I haven't posted any other musings during my time on the course but seeing as this looks like the last blog in phase-0 I thought I would add one. I may have missed it but I think one thing not covered in the course material/Search Inside Yourself, is it is sometimes the best option to give up on something. I am a believer in the notion anyone can learn anything with right approach and you should exhaust all options before quitting, but sometimes it just isn't worth it to continue something, especially if you aren't ennjoying it. For example when I was little I remember having a cardboard model of a helicopter and pieces kept falling off it and was very frustrating and fiddly to fix. One day I got so angry I took the model and burnt it, and it was a huge relief to never worry about it ever again! During the course there were times when I wanted to add something to my code and I just had to drop it, sometimes after working at it for hours and it was best decision.</p>
