             <h4> What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness??</h4>
             <p>They are two sides of the same coin. Mindfulness makes you able to cultivate self-awareness, and the more aware of yourself you are, the better you are to remain mindful. 
             </p>

             <h4> Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</h4>
             <p>I did the Body Scan and it was interesting. It made me feel very aware of my body, and like I was strengthening my focus and attention.  </p>
             <h4>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not me" section?</h4>
             <p>I really like Marcus Aurelius. He is my favourite Emperor. I like the idea of not being captive to feelings because they can really take control of you when you might need to be considerate the most. Though you shouldn't be completely detached from them, it is good to recognise they are not you, they are happening to you</p>
