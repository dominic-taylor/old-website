             <h4>What a responsive site is, and why responsiveness is important</h4>  
             <p>A responsive site is one where the look of the webpage changes depending on the type of device it is viewed on. For example a page may become simpler and more important information easier to navigate to, when viewed on a mobile phone screen, in order to make it quicker to load and use on a smaller and less powerful device.</p>


            <h4>What mobile first design is, and why it's important </h4>
            <p> Mobile first design is the idea web developers should code to make their web pages look good on mobile devies first, and having them change responsively as screen width increases. It is important as more and more people view web sites on mobile devices, but as developers we have generally looked at the internet on desktop computers. This approach also makes pages easier for less powerful devices to load as they don't have to parse a whole lot of code to make a page fit it's screen.  </p>


             <h4> What frameworks are, and their pros and cons </h4>
            <p> A framework is prewritten code for websites, for example buttons, forms and layouts. The pros are, it is quicker to develop a webpage using prewritten code, and pages can be consistent across browsers. Cons include having to learn a new framework could take time, and the possiblity of becoming over reliant on a framework, rather than learning how to do things yourself.  </p>

            <h4>What a wireframe is and why we use it</h4>
            <p>A wireframe is a simple diagram of a webpage, like a blueprint, in order to see where the major elements should be arranged. A developer uses a wireframe to get an understanding of what their code should be to achieve he look of the diagram.</p>

<h4>The aspects of your wireframes you found difficult to implement, and why</h4>
<p>
  Probably the most difficult thing was trying to get my webpage to be responsive and look good in a mobile layout. I think I just didn't spend enough time on it in general, and I underestimated how hard it would be to get anything decent up and running.
