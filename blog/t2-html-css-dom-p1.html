<h4>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend? </h4>
<p> I think a good analogy is plans for a house. HTML is like the essential structure of a webpage that everything else hangs on, like the frame, roof, walls and floors of a house. CSS is the stuff that makes a house livable and useable, like windows, doors, colours and basic furniture. The DOM (Document Object Model) is less clear to me at this stage. The house analogy doesn't carry as well, but the DOM is a standardised way of reading HTML/CSS so the code can be shown as a webpage on any browser, sort of like the blueprints of our house are a standard way to look at any building.  </p>


 <h4>  What is meant by boxifying design? </h4>
<p> Boxifying desing is a way to break down a webpage desgin into rectanglular sections. By dividing the visual idea of a page down a developer can start to see how they could put the code together to produce it as a webpage. </p>

<h4>What is the box model?</h4>
<p>All HTML elevemts can be considered as boxes and the box model is a term used when talking about page desging and layout. Every element on a page like an image, link or paragraph is contained within a box which defines its' parameters. There are different parts of the box model, which from the inside-out are; </p>
<ul>
  <li>Content: where text or images etc appear. </li>
  <li>Padding: the space between the content and the border of the box. </li>
  <li>Border: the border which goes around the paddign and content </li>
  <li>Margin: the space betwwen the element and other elements</li>
</ul>
