             <h4> How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild</h4>
             <p>
                It made me less concerned about my site being perfect and more focused on trying to make something functional that included at least some of my wish list ideas.
             </p>

             <h4> What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2? </h4>
             <p>Before chapter 2 I think I knew a bit about meditation and had practiced it, but often I would end up forgetting to do it regulary!</p>
             <h4>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h4>
             <p>The difference between mindfullness and concentration was interesting, as well as the different modes of self.  </p>
             <h4> Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h4>
             <p>I like the point about not worrying about the mind wandering when trying to concentrate because it is inevitable and can be a real obstacle to meditation if you are stressing you have done it wrong.</p>
