 <h4>  What was your experience extending the racer game? 
 </h4>
  <p> My original game alreaedy had the added feature of the user being able to decide the length of the track and given it 
    was a pretty heavy work load this week, it was hard to decide on something that would be challenging but acheivable. I was also not 100% sure
    if I should spend no more time on it than the 6 hours suggested in the assignment brief. However, in week 9, I had a lot of free time and was able
    to add the feature (mines which send the player back a few spaces) to my game, and consider other things I wanted to add to it. I definitly feel like I had a better idea of how to approch the work compared to the first version of the game which is very encouraging.

<h4>Did you learn anything while building the calculator?
</h4>
<p> Yes. Specifically I learned about the built in eval() function from my partner Suresh, which he used to build a function to calculate expressions. I also learned why some design decisions are common to most calculators, for example only allowing one number on the display at a time. My first idea was to have the entire expression displayed (i.e 12 + 4 x 5) and then parse this string somehow when = is pressed. But it is much simpler to store the first number in a variable and apply the operation to it with the second number which is how most calculators work. Working with someone else was also very interesting. I think we have slightly different approaches to problems and when we met to code for the first and only time in person I was a little worried we would struggle to finish on time. But as it turned out we worked on our project on alternate days and it was a encouraging to return to it and find something that needed doing completed.    </p>
